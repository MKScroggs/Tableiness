A truth table generator created for my Software Development final project.  Project was build in a team with Bryce Lawrence, Tyler Scott, and myself.

Project was sponsered by the Discrete Math teacher to use as an aid in teaching students Boolean logic.

Project includes a GUI, support of complex user entered expressions containing up to 26 variables, dynamic table generation on user input, and LaTeX symbol support.
